# KeyboardDirectionMixin

This mixin maps arrow and Home/End keys to semantic direction methods. This
allows a developer to quickly support directional navigation in a component, and
to avoid common pitfalls. For example, a component listening to presses of the
Left or Right keys should take care to _not_ handle those keys if a meta key
(Command key on Macs, Windows key on Windows) or alt key (Option key on Macs,
Alt key on Windows) are pressed, as that would interfere with browser navigation
shortcuts.

This mixin relies on [symbols.keydown](symbols#keydown) being invoked. The
typical  way to do that is with [KeyboardMixin](KeyboardMixin), but you can
always handle keyboard events and invoke the method yourself.

The supported mapping of direction keys to direction methods is:

* **Down** key → invokes [symbols.goDown](symbols#goDown) if vertical navigation
  is enabled. If the Alt key is pressed, this invokes
  [symbols.goEnd](symbols#goEnd).
* **End** key → invokes [symbols.goEnd](symbols#goEnd).
* **Home** key → invokes [symbols.goStart](symbols#goStart).
* **Left** key → invokes [symbols.goLeft](symbols#goLeft) if horizontal
  navigation is enabled. If the meta key or alt key is pressed, the key is
  ignored.
* **Right** key → invokes [symbols.goRight](symbols#goRight) if horizontal
  navigation is enabled. If the meta key or alt key is pressed, the key is
  ignored.
* **Up** key → invokes [symbols.goUp](symbols#goUp) if vertical navigation is
  enabled. If the Alt key is pressed, this invokes
  [symbols.goStart](symbols#goStart).

If your goal is to map direction semantics to selection semantics (e.g., to have
direction keys navigate a list of items), you can use
[DirectionSelectionMixin](DirectionSelectionMixin) for that purpose.

The mixin inspects a property called [symbols.orientation](symbols#orientation)
to determine whether horizontal navigation, vertical navigation, or both are
enabled. Valid values for that property are "horizontal", "vertical", or "both",
respectively. The default value is "both".
