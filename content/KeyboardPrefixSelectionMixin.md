# KeyboardPrefixSelectionMixin

This mixin handles list box-style prefix typing, in which the user can type a
string to select the first item that begins with that string.

[A list box that supports prefix typing](/demos/listBox.html)

If this component receives the focus, and you press the "b" or "B"
key, the "Banana" item will be selected, because it's the first item that
matches the prefix "b". (Matching is case-insensitive.) If you now
presses the "l" or "L" key quickly, the prefix to match becomes "bl", so
"Blackberry" will be selected.

The prefix typing feature has a one second timeout — the prefix to match
will be reset after a second has passed since you last typed a key.
If, in the above example, you wait a second between typing "b" and
"l", the timeout will reset the prefix to empty. When the "l" key is pressed,
"Lemon" will be selected.

If you press the Backspace key, the last character is removed from the prefix
under construction. This re-selects the first item that matches the new, shorter
prefix. Suppose you type "c", and "Cantaloupe" is selected, then type "h" to
select "Cherry". If you now immediately press Backspace (before the
aforementioned one second timeout elapses), the prefix will revert to "C", and
"Cantaloupe" will be reselected.

This mixin expects the component to invoke [symbols.keydown](symbols#keydown)
method when a key is pressed. This can be provided by
[KeyboardMixin](KeyboardMixin).

This mixin also expects the component to provide an `items` property that
returns the list's items. You can supply that with
[SingleSelectionMixin](SingleSelectionMixin).

To extract the text of an item, the mixin invokes a method
[symbols.getItemText](symbols#getItemText) on each item. The default behavior of
that method is to return the item's `alt` attribute or, if that does not exist,
its `textContent`. This allows a component user to customize which text the
prefix will be matched against.

For performance, the mixin caches the extracted text of the items. This cache is
invalidated whenever the component or its mixins invoke
[symbols.itemsChanged](symbols#itemsChanged).
