# DirectionSelectionMixin

This mixin maps direction semantics (e.g., "down") to selection semantics
("selectNext"). When a direction method with a standard identifier is invoked, a
corresponding selection method is invoked:

* [symbols.goDown](symbols#goDown) → `selectNext`
* [symbols.goEnd](symbols#goEnd) → `selectLast`
* [symbols.goLeft](symbols#goLeft) → `selectPrevious`
* [symbols.goRight](symbols#goRight) → `selectNext`
* [symbols.goStart](symbols#goStart) → `selectFirst`
* [symbols.goUp](symbols#goUp) → `selectPrevious`

A common use of `DirectionSelectionMixin` will be to connect the
[KeyboardMixin](KeyboardMixin) and
[KeyboardDirectionMixin](KeyboardDirectionMixin) above to the Elix
[SingleSelectionMixin](SingleSelectionMixin). This effectively creates a chain
of actions that convert keyboard events to changes in selection.

Example: a press of the Down arrow key can be handled in the following steps:

1. [KeyboardMixin](KeyboardMixin) receives the `keydown` event for the Down arrow key and
   invokes the component's `symbols.keydown` method.
2. [KeyboardDirectionMixin](KeyboardDirectionMixin) handles `symbols.keydown` for the key, and invokes
   `symbols.goDown`.
3. `DirectionSelectionMixin` handles `symbols.goDown` and invokes `selectNext`.
4. [SingleSelectionMixin](SingleSelectionMixin) handles `selectNext` and updates the selection.

This sequence may seem circuitous, but factoring the behaviors this way allows
other forms of interaction. E.g., a separate mixin to handle touch gestures only
has to map a "swipe left" gesture to a direction method like `goRight` in order
to patch into this chain. This saves the touch logic from having to know
anything about selection.
