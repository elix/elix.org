# Developer documentation

This section is organized into several areas:

* [Elements](/documentation/elements):Â web components which you can use directly
  in your web projects, or as starting points for your own components. These
  elements do their best to meet [Gold Standard checklist for Web
  Components](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki), a rigorous
  standard for ensuring a high level of component quality.

* [Mixins](/documentation/mixins): aspects of component behavior that can be
  combined to create functional web components that meet the Gold Standard.

* [Wrappers](/documentation/wrappers): a kind of mixin that adds visible
  elements to a component's template.

* [Helpers](/documentation/helpers): low-level functions used by the above, and
  also avaible for cases where you need to build your own solution.
